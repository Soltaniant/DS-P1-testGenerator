# DS-P1-testGenerator

what is this?
-------------
this is an automated test generator and checker for the first phase of DS project(Dr Safarnejad Boroujeni).
It will:
- show the missing words which your code doesn't find
- show the approximate execution time for each query

How to use it?
-------------
to use, you need to have a function(e.g `find()`) which returns the list of words that matches with the query.
this list will be used to assert your result correctness.
steps:
1. Add your code including classes and functions (except driver codes!)
2. In the last loop, assign your final answer(the list which returned by your find method) to the myResult variable.
3. Run the program! it will hopefully accept your answer! if not, you may need to think more :)

How does it work?
-------------
it generally uses Regex module to find the correct answer of each query and check the result with the answer generated by your code
as input, it uses a text file(included in "texts" folder) and also generate a query by randomly choosing a word and converting it to a regex-like string.
